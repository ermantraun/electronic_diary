An "electronic diary" web application (currently unfinished).

To properly deploy and launch the application you need:

1) Install packages from requirements.txt -> pip install -r requirements.txt (some packages are native packages of the application, but it was decided to make them installable)

2) Remove "template" from the names of all configs
